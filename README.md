Once upon a time in the future, there was an orphan that grew up wanting everything he never had. As time passed by, the orphan grew up having the dream of one day owning his own spaceship. One day on his way back home he saw a big billboard announcing a new type of spaceship, not just a regular type but the fastest and largest ship. Having experience the most angelical image in his life he quickly ran back home and started thinking about ways to get the new spaceship. The next day he decided to go to the emperor to ask for a loan. His loan was granted but with the exception of paying it back before 65 years, otherwise he would be executed. The emperor did add that another option in order for him to get out of the debt he could pay him a lump sum of 1M emperial credits. The orphan quickly acquired his new spaceship and embarked his new journey to the closest planet to start repaying the emperors money.
