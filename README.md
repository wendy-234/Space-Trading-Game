Once upon a time in the future, there was an orphan that grew up wanting everything he never had. As time passed by, the orphan grew up having the dream of one day owning his own spaceship. One day on his way back home he saw a big billboard announcing a new type of spaceship, not just a regular type but the fastest and largest ship. Having experienced the most angelical image in his life, he quickly ran back home and started thinking about ways to get the new spaceship. The next day he decided to go to the emperor to ask for a loan. His loan was granted but with the stipulation of paying 20% interest for 65 years. If he does not pay the loan off by 65 years, then he would be executed. The emperor did add another option; in order to get out of the debt, he could pay a lump sum of 1M imperial credits. The orphan quickly acquired his new spaceship and embarked on his new journey to the closest planet to start repaying the emperors money.
